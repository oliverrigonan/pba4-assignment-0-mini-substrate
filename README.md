<h1 align="center">Pre - Course Assignment</h1>

The pre-course assignment guides students through an initial exposure to some content before the course begins.
We encourage all students to complete this assignment to the best of your ability, as you would for the in-course assignments.

## Content

This assignment covers two main areas of content

1. **Rust Macros** - We made sure you had some basic macro skills in the qualifier.
Macros are used a lot in FRAME, so we want to help everyone brush up on the more advanced topics.
By completing this portion of the assignment, you will be prepared to encounter the macros used in FRAME.

2. **Mini Substrate** - We have found that students who have some existing familiarity with Substrate, find the course's pace more enjoyable. This portion of the assignment is intended to give students exactly this familiarity. This content will be covered in much more depth in the academy.

## Time Commitment

We expect this assignment will take around 10 - 15 hours.
Your exact time spent will likely depend on your existing familiarity with Substrate and Rust's macro system.

## Honor Code

The first section of the assignment is the honor code.
Please read it _carefully and thoughtfully_ before you start work.

Most importantly, **SHARING or PUBLISHING the EXAM or SOLUTIONS is FORBIDDEN!**

## Working Through the Assignment

This assignment structure is a continuation of the qualifier exam that you already completed.
Like in the qualifier, each module contains some well-commented starter code, and some `todo!()`s that you should replace with solution code.
Github Classrooms gives you a private remote repository to push your work to as you go.

## Tests

Each module contains a small starter test suite to help you know whether your solutions are on the right track or not.
You can run these tests with standard cargo commands.
The provided tests are mostly failing when you first begin, but they should all pass by the time you are finished.

```sh
# Run the unit tests
cargo test

# Run the doc tests
cargo test --doc
```

The provided tests are **not** a complete test suite.
You are encouraged to write additional tests to ensure that their code works as intended.

## Completing the Exam

When all the provided tests pass, plus all the additional tests you wrote are passing, your work is finished.
Make sure your work is pushed to your private github classroom repository.

### License and Use Policies

**SHARING or PUBLISHING the EXAM or SOLUTIONS is FORBIDDEN!**
Unlike the qualifier exam, this assignment is private.
You may not share the Problems or Solutions.
